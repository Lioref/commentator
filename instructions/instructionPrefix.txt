I would like you to rewrite code-review comments for me following a few basic guidelines:
1. re-write the comment to be about the same length as the original. Don't make it too long!
2. don't add any extra insights that were not in the original comment. I don't want to see any code suggestions if those don't appear in the original comment.
3. Return the rewritten comment without any prefix or suffix.
